  ## Acknowldgements 
  
  These princples were adapted from [DHSC Coding Princples](https://mattm-dhsc.github.io/coding_principles_book/) by Matthew Malcher, which in turn were inspired by MOJ [Coding Princples and Standards](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/our-coding-standards/web/)

## Version Control

To ensure changes are well documented, errors are easier to trace, and work is not lost or overwritten, use version control.  The standard approach to do this from RStudio is to separate each piece of work into individual Projects and use "Git".  

### Git

Git can track a folder (aka repo) so that changes are identified and commented.  This then builds a log which can be used to restore older versions if necessary.

A repository is Git's encompassing of the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called **commits** (versions), these commits can be organized into multiple lines of development called **branches** (seperate areas of development on the same project). Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a Git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, **cloning** (copying), creating branches, committing (saving a version), **merging** (bringing two versions together), comparing changes across versions of code, and more.

### Structure

### Naming Conventions

When naming variables, functions or files, strive for names that are concise and meaningful (e.g. var1 is less useful than var_density).  To differentiate between different components in your code, you may want to use:
  
  - Files: underscore_separated, all lower case: e.g. numeric_version
- Functions: period.separated, all lower case: e.g. my.function
- Variables: lowerCamelCase: e.g. addTaskCall

A new user to your code wants to quickly gain an overview and be able to run the code.  For this some basic context and an indication of what the user needs alongside the code to run it is required.  

Start each file with a comment saying who wrote it and when, what it attempts to do, and a general overview of sections within the code.  Next state all source files required (e.g. "data_cars.csv") and any other functions or codes which are called within the code.  Now state all required packages by putting all library statements together here.  Finally, if there are any file paths or user controls then state these at the start or at least reference where in the code they are.

Do not write lines of code longer than 80 characters.  This is because on some screen settings, parts of your code will be requiring horizontal scrolling to see the whole code which is not only annoying but an easy source of errors.  It's useful to put 80 #'s at the beginning to remind yourself not to go past this.

Comment your code stating Why not What. 

Use white space to separate activities into clear steps.

Use tabulations to highlight connecting for and if statements. 

Structure the sections of the code so that if possible all data is brought in at the beginning, then the data is manipulated, linked and transformed into the required final state, then the data is analysed, and finally outputs and visualisations are created and saved.  Separate each section clearly to help the reader know when a milestone has been reached.
